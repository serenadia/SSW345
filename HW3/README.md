# REST HW

Below are the screenshots of the results of the test cases after running the test file. I could not figure out how to pass the last three test cases. I also was not able to complete the REST server exercise. 

I could not properly commit the REST folder to my HW3 folder in my repo, so I manually added all the files used.
